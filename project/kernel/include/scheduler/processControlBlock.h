/**
 * Registers r6-r10 should be saved, C depends on their values being the same when returning from
 * a subroutine.
 *
 * r0-r3 are scratch registers: They're used for as arguments to the syscall. Thus we don't need
 * them for the execution state
 *
 * r4, r5 are general purpouse registers. These contain the SP, and LR of the user when switching
 * contexts so keeping these registers is not necessary when resuming, and can thus be omitted.
 *
 * ! Throwing an interrupt, however, is not a subroutine. Thus they should be saved, since
 * they can hold any data that might be important to execution.
 *
 * Registers r11-r15 are special registers, and especially important when restoring the state of the
 * process
 *
 * r11 - fp - Frame Pointer: Points to the bottom of the current stack; tracks the boundary of the
 * stack r12 is another scratch register (ip - Intra Procedure call register). This might be
 * important to execution r15 - pc - Program Counter: The memory address of the next instruction
 * cpsr - Current Program Status Register: Contains all the status flags
 *
 * This register can be omitted:
 * r13 - sp - Stack Pointer: Point to the top of the current stack (of the subroutine). Since this
 *                           struct will be pushed directly onto the stack, and we have to return a
 *                           reference to it, we can deduce where the end of the stack was.
 *
 * Note: These names are relative to the process in question. This being intuitive is up for debate
 * Ex. when the process is interrupted. The PC is stored in LP. We thus save the 'current' LP in the
 * variable PC.
 *
 * Note: When doing a syscall r7 is used to check which subroutine to call
