/**
    Save state will save the state of a process (execution state) onto the stack of said process, and return the address pointing to the top of the stack.

    Execution state:
        The process state essentially consists of all the registers

        - r0-r12 (general purpose registers)
        - lr
        - spsr
        - pc

    Return value:
        top of the user stack, including the execution state.


    An important thing to remember while reading this code is that there are certain registers that are 'banked'
    when switching to a different mode. This means that they will not be overwritten when switching from one mode
    to another. It is thus also important that we save the user banked registers (sp, and lr), and not those of the
    current mode
