/**
 * These permissions dictate who can access what pages. Note that you
 * cannot combine these arbitrarily. For example:
 * VM_PERM_PRIVILEGED_RO|VM_PERM_PRIVILEGED_RW
 * makes no sense. If the user mode is granted a given permission, then the
 * privileged mode is granted that permission as well, unless there is a
 * confliction. Some examples:
 * VM_PERM_USER_RO
 * grants RO status to both user and privileged modes.
 *
 * VM_PERM_USER_RO|VM_PERM_PRIVILEGED_RW
 * grants RO to the user, and RW to privileged modes.
 *
 * VM_PERM_USER_RW|VM_PERM_PRIVILEGED_RO
 * doesn't make sense. USER_RW grants RW to both user and privileged, but
 * PRIVILEGED_RO contradicts the USER_RW's implied grant.
 *
 * VM_ERR_BADPERM is returned if a bad permission is passed. Note that 0
 * is a valid permission, indicating that nobody may have access.
 *
 * (RO stands for Read-Only, RW for Read-Write)
