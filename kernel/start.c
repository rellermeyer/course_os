/*
 *  A bit of background:
 *  - The ARM architecture has 7 modes of operation:
 *      + USR - user mode
 *      + FIQ - processing "fast" interrupts
 *      + IRQ - processing "normal" interrupts
 *      + SVC - proctected mode for OS
 *      + UND - processing an undefined instruction exception
 *      + SYS - also protecteed mode for OS --if anyone wants to clarify, feel free--
 *
 *  - These modes can be entered or exited by modifying the CPSR (status register), first 5 bits
 *	+ 0b10000 = user mode
 *	+ 0b10001 = FIQ (fast interrupt) mode
 *	+ 0b10010 = IRQ (normal interrupt) mode
 *	+ 0b10011 = SVC (supervisor, or, OS) mode
 *	(others...)
